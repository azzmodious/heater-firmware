# heater-firmware

## description
This project is to make my old furnace answerable to my amazon echo using a raspberry pie and a relay board. The idea is that I can spoof a wemo signature on the network so the amazon echo knows what to do when I tell it to discover devices. 

## Setup 
Setup is simple. You will need fauxmo js and a lib for gpio control. I am sticking with javascript this time but I might come back and do it in put typescript. 
```
npm install
```
